# sqlite-html-windows-x64

A `sqlite-html` platform-specific package for `windows-x64`. 

When `sqlite-html` is installed and the host computer has a `windows` operating system with `x64` architecture, then this package is downloaded with the pre-compiled SQLite extension bundled under `lib/html0.dll`. At runtime, the `sqlite-html` package will resolve to this platform-specific package for use with [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)' or [`node-sqlite3`](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3).

See the `sqlite-html` package for more details.
