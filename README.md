# sqlite-html

A SQLite extension for querying, manipulating, and creating HTML elements.

- Extract HTML or text from HTML with CSS selectors, like `.querySelector()`, `.innerHTML`, and `.innerText`
- Generate a table of matching elements from a CSS selector, like `.querySelectorAll()`
- Safely create HTML elements in a query, like `.createElement()` and `.appendChild()`

## ðŸš§ðŸš§ Work In Progress! ðŸš§ðŸš§

This library is experimental and subject to change. I plan to make a stable beta release and subsequent v0+v1 in the near future, so use with caution.

When v0 is ready (with a mostly stable API), I will make a release (so watch this repo for that) and will make a blog post, feel free to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/agarcia_me) to get notified of that.

## Installing

## Documentation

See [`api.md`](./api.md) for a full API reference.

## Overview

`sqlite-html`'s API is modeled after the official [JSON1](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html#jmini) SQLite extension.

This extension is also written in Go, thanks to [riyaz-ali/sqlite](https://github.com/riyaz-ali/sqlite). While this library aims to be fast and efficient, it is overall slower than what a pure C SQLite extension could be (mostly because cgo is slow), but in practice you probably won't notice much of a difference.
